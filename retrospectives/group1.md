### How do you feel?
- exhausted, but learned a lot
- yes, and a little overwhelmed by all the new information, but also exhausted to apply some of this!
- yes, and grateful because I learned a lot!  I was worried yesterday about the pace, because I thought we might not get to the applied part, but we did so much today!  I'm super impresed by how much we were able to do!

### What did you like?
- I've taken workshops in the past that were a lot like the exercises you shared, but it was abstract.  Here, we got to really explore the kind of data we have in the lab, and we got to really see what we want do do!
- I like the teamwork!  Sometimes it's a bit frustrating because you want to keep doing the same thing, but I liked that you get experience with different people and different problems
I also liked that you could choose what you wanted to do and find what is most helpful.  I liked that there were three of you.  I often feel I know in principle what I need to do, but I don't know the functions, oso most of the time there was someone next to me who could give me some advice.


### What did you learn?
-  Seaborn.  I learned a lot about seaborn, and saw a hundred types of plots that you can make!
- I learned how to approach such a big dataset with that many variables and not be afraid trying something out.  I learned what to ask, and what to look for.
-  I learned not to be afraid oby the data, just to look at it!  I also learned the imporatance of structuring your code, to use markdown to make these sections.  Also the imporatnce of making copies to refrecnece your code later.  I also learned the imporstnace of switching every hour, crating somethng, and then starting over.
